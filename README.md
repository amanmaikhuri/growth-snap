# growth-snap
Growth Snap is a minimalist app to log your daily wins, struggles, and goals, spiced up with 40+ mood emojis and a light/dark mode toggle. Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s my first project as a web dev—perfect for anyone who loves tracking growth with a fun twist!
