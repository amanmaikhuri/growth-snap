Growth Snap

A minimalist journaling app to track your daily wins, struggles, goals, and mood—with a fun, clean UI and full browser-side functionality.

✨ Overview
Growth Snap is a lightweight, browser-based journaling app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps you reflect on your personal growth by letting you log your daily wins, struggles, and goals, topped with 40+ expressive mood emojis. Whether you’re a developer, student, or just into self-tracking, this app adds a light and fun twist to self-reflection.

This is my first project as a budding web developer transitioning from a Master’s in Mathematics—designed to grow alongside me and, hopefully, you too!

👨‍💻 About Me
Hey, I’m Aman!
Currently 3 months into my web dev journey after completing my Master’s in Mathematics. Growth Snap is my first full project—where I’ve merged logic, design, and purpose to build something meaningful.

Feel free to fork, use, or contribute if you’re into minimalist self-growth tools too!
